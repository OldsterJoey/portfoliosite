            <h2>Ever since I could walk, I've loved computers</h2>
            <p>
                When I was a kid, some of my fondest memories were getting home from school and asking my mum if I could use the family computer to play flash games on the internet, which at the time, was close
                to magic in my eyes. I spent a lot of my time trying my best to grasp the concepts on how it all worked, mostly so I could download my favourite video games and make my own movies with different
                pieces of software, that I knew how to use, but didn't truly understand. Little did I know how important all that I learnt about computers as a child would become such an important and fundamental
                part of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've tried quite a few different things in my short time as an adult. Evolving from my teen years as a fast food worker, I branched out, becoming a part time social worker for disabled children,
                and a waiter for big events held at a 5 star hotel in the city of Melbourne. During this, I attempted to study 3D art and animation for video games at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment.
                However, I quickly found myself getting more excited about the work of the programmers in the classroom opposite mine. It was then that I decided that if I was to pursue studying again, I would
                be behind a keyboard instead of a drawing tablet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays, I spend most of my time working as a bartender and studying software development at Coder Academy Melbourne, and in my spare time, I love making my own films, playing video games, and
                practicing guitar. I am happy where I am, and as long as I have my hands I will continue to do the same.

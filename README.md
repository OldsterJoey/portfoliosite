## Functionality & Features
All content of the site is easily explorable due to my navbar feature, and includes a projects and blog section, that format content within the container automatically, my resume in the form of an online PDF, and a contacts section with all my social media connected by links. It also features Sub Resource Integrity attached to each of my CSS files in order to give my website security.
